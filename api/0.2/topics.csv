1,Immigration and citizenship [1],Immigration and citizenship,0,,,,"Japanese immigrants began arriving in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century when workers were recruited to meet the growing need for low-wage laborers in the Territory of Hawaii and on the West Coast. Commodore Perry had opened Japan to American commerce and trade relations in 1853, but anti-Asian sentiment resulted in the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907, which halted the immigration of workers from Japan. In 1910, the Japanese population was about 80,000 in Hawaii and 72,000 on the continental United States. Japanese women continued to enter the country until the 1924 Immigration Act cut off immigration from Japan to the United States. Most of the early Japanese immigrants, the Issei (first generation), came as contract agricultural laborers, although many others were students and merchants. While Japanese immigrants were prohibited by discriminatory laws from becoming naturalized citizens of the United States, their American-born children (nisei) held U.S. citizenship.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800
2,Life in Japan and reasons for leaving [2],Life in Japan and reasons for leaving,1,,,,"Most of the Issei (first-generation) immigrants belonged to the peasant farming class that had been hurt by industrialization, inflation, and rising taxes caused by the Meiji government's modernization program. The majority of the immigrant workers came from the four prefectures of Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka. The country was hard hit by depression following the Russo-Japanese war, which ended in 1905. Hoping for better economic opportunity than was available in the rigid society of Japan -- then just emerging from the feudal era -- ambitious men, especially younger sons who would not inherit property, traveled to the new country with the dream of making their fortune. Pioneer Issei women -- the first Japanese women to receive public education under Meiji reforms -- joined them as brides, many seeking to avoid living under the authority of their marital families.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800
3,The Journey [3],The Journey,1,,,,"The Issei (first-generation Japanese immigrants) crossed the Pacific in crowded steamships for the two-week journey to the West Coast of the United States. Thousands of immigrants left Japan from Yokohama Harbor outside Tokyo and entered the U.S. at Angel Island, the immigration station in San Francisco Bay. The immigrants were examined and inoculated for communicable diseases upon boarding and examined again upon arrival. Because it took time to obtain a visa and the necessary health clearances, the journey from one's hometown in Japan could extend up to a month.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800
4,Arrival [4],Arrival,1,,,,"Labor contractors transported workers from Japan to work on Hawaiian sugar plantations. Many Japanese then emigrated to the mainland and worked for lumber companies, railroads, and canneries. In the early 1900s these immigrants began to establish families through the picture bride system (shashin-kekkon, literally ""photograph marriage""). Immigrant bachelors sent photographs and information about themselves to go-betweens (baishakunin) who arranged meetings with the families in Japan. Marriage ceremonies took place in Japan (without bridegrooms), then the new brides traveled to the United States to join their husbands. Many arrived to discover that their husbands had misrepresented their appearances or situations.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800

6,Agriculture [6],Agriculture,5,,,,"Many Issei (first-generation Japanese immigrants) began as sharecroppers. Others sought to buy land, but the Issei had to overcome obstacles preventing them from competing with white farmers. California and other states passed alien land laws prohibiting Asian immigrants from purchasing or leasing agricultural land. There were ways around the discriminatory laws: an Issei father could put the property in the name of his American-born child, or issei could form corporations in which a majority of the shareholders were American citizens. Despite the alien land laws, Issei farmers played a significant role in West Coast agriculture. In the years just prior to World War II, Japanese American families grew 35 percent of the produce in California. By the 1920s, Japanese Americans supplied 75 percent of the produce and half the milk to the Puget Sound region.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800

They traveled by ship to the cannery towns, where they slowly developed small communities whose population swelled with the yearly arrival of workers. Issei (Japanese immigrant) entrepreneurs started the oyster industry from scratch in Puget Sound.

Wages were low -- about $1.50 per week in 1900 -- but room and board were provided, and living with an American family provided a means of quickly learning the English language and American customs. After the war, for want of better jobs, dispossessed older Issei and college-age Nisei (their American-born children) again took employment as domestics for well-to-do families.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800

The organization was decidedly patriotic and dealt with discrimination by emphasizing American citizenship, loyalty, and assimilation. Because of their ideology, JACL members were recruited by the military to assist in carrying out the ""evacuation"" orders, and they urged Japanese Americans to cooperate with the government. The group inspired strong, mixed feelings among Japanese Americans during this time.

Some were pressured to do so by family members or extremists; others were bitter about their mistreatment by the government. In total, only 4,724 ended up leaving for Japan directly from the camps and many eventually returned to the U.S. Nearly all Nisei who wanted to were able to regain their citizenship, although the process was long and difficult.",2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800,2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800
