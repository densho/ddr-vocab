Under existing laws, naturalization was limited to \"free white persons and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\" Despite many attempts by Japanese immigrants (Issei) to gain citizenship, they were usually rejected on the grounds that the Issei were neither white nor black. The 1922 Supreme Court case Ozawa v. U.S. cemented the status of the issei as \"aliens ineligible to citizenship\" once and for all. It wasn't until 1952 with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act that Issei were finally allowed to become naturalized U.S. citizens.\nBT Immigration and citizenship\nRT Anti-immigration sentiment, Arrival, Law and legislation, Life in Japan and reasons for leaving, Picture brides, The Journey", "created": "2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800", "modified": "2014-02-18T17:06:20-0800", "id": 176, "parent_id": 1, "siblings": [178, 4, 340, 2, 342, 3], "encyc_urls": "", "title": "Naturalization", "path": "Immigration and citizenship: Naturalization", "children": [], "_title": "Naturalization [176]"}, {"parent": 1, "description": "", "weight": "", "format": "Picture brides\nBT Immigration and citizenship\nRT Anti-immigration sentiment, Arrival, Law and legislation, Life in Japan and reasons for leaving, Naturalization, The Journey", "created": "", "modified": "", "id": 342, "parent_id": 1, "siblings": [178, 4, 340, 2, 176, 3], "encyc_urls": "", "title": "Picture brides", "path": "Immigration and citizenship: Picture brides", "children": [], "_title": "Picture brides  [342]"}, {"parent": 1, "description": "The Issei (first-generation Japanese immigrants) crossed the Pacific in crowded steamships for the two-week journey to the West Coast of the United States.
